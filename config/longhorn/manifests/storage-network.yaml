# NetworkAttachmentDefinition for Longhorn storage network
# Uses macvlan on enp1s0 (storage interface) with static IPs via host-local
# This ensures pods get consistent IPs from a defined range,
# preventing stale IP issues during replica rebuilds.
# Range: 192.168.42.32-63 (/27) - DHCP uses 200+ so no conflict
# Reference: https://longhorn.io/docs/1.10.1/advanced-resources/deploy/storage-network/
